      <description>I woke up with a mood of refreshing my blog today.
I went through the content of my old million-times-hacked-wordpress website and decided to give something new a try.
The only requirement I set was my new blog to be not a dynamic website.
After some deep 5-min research, I ended up setting up a Jekyll and a Hugo template project.
Long story short, I felt more comfortable with Hugo, mainly because I found a really clean and miminal template from Vicky Lai called Call me Sam.</description>

      <description>This article will be devoted to a major task that should be considered before designing the next $$$$-billion start-up. It&amp;rsquo;s all about planning technologies, processes, the future, monetization, databases everything. When you develop technology products, many things can go wrong and you should be ahead by following a strict plan.
Below I cite the plan that I usually follow when building the ideas I have (unsuccessfully most of the times but I believe this is a good plan though!</description>
