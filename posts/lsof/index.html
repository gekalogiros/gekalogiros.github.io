<h1 id="life-in-the-terminal-volume-1">Life in the Terminal - Volume 1</h1>

<p>The terminal is the best friend of an application developer. There are multiple tools that can be piped together to extract meaningful insights for the problem at hand without developing a single line of code.</p>

<p>Today we will be exploring lsof</p>

<h1 id="lsof">LSOF</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p><code>lsof</code> is a command line tool that can be used for analyzing open files. The definition of <code>file</code> in a unix-based system is very wide: It can represent directories, text files, sockets or streams.</p>

<h2 id="display-running-files">Display Running Files</h2>

<p>The simplest, but not very meaningful, exercise that we can do with <code>lsof</code> is listing all open files in a running system:</p>

<pre><code>$ lsof
COMMAND     PID  USER          FD      TYPE   DEVICE    SIZE/OFF                NODE NAME
loginwind   143  georgios      cwd     DIR    1,5         640                   2 
</code></pre>

<p>The above command will produce a very long list which is not easy manageable by the human brain.</p>

<p>We can split the list into multiple pages by leveraging the powerful <code>more</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ lsof | more
COMMAND     PID  USER          FD      TYPE   DEVICE    SIZE/OFF                NODE NAME
loginwind   143  georgios      cwd     DIR    1,5         640                   2
</code></pre>

<h2 id="understanding-output-columns">Understanding Output Columns</h2>

<p>The above output contains multiple columns that might not make sense initially.</p>

<p>By Looking at <code>man lsof</code>, it is straightforward to understand what all these magic numbers and acronyms are about.</p>

<ul>
<li>COMMAND
This is the process name managing the open files</li>
<li>PID
This is the id of the process managing the open files</li>
<li>USER
This is the user running the current process</li>
<li>FD
This is a more complex one if you have never come across file descriptors before. <code>FD</code> can be a number or a string describing the file descriptor. It can be one of these values:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>cwd: current working directory
Lnn: library references (AIX)
err: FD information error (see NAME column)
jld: jail directory (FreeBSD)
ltx: shared library text (code and data)
Mxx: hex memory-mapped type number xx
m86: DOS Merge mapped file
mem: memory-mapped file
mmap: memory-mapped device
pd: parent directory
rtd: root directory
tr: kernel trace file (OpenBSD)
txt: program text (code and data)
v86: VP/ix mapped file
</code></pre>

<p>It can also be a cryptic number followed by some random characters. It might seem a bit random at the first sight but it is not:
    * The number defines the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor">file descriptor</a>
    * The character that follows defines the access:</p>

<pre><code>r: read
w: write
u: update
space: unknown
-: unknown locked
</code></pre>

<pre><code>* The next character that follows defines the lock type:
</code></pre>

<pre><code>N: Solaris NFS lock of unknown type
r: read lock on part of the file
R: a read lock on the entire file
w: write lock on part of the file
W: write lock on the entire file
u: read and write lock of any length
U: lock of unknown type
x: SCO OpenServer Xenix lock on part of the file
X: SCO OpenServer Xenix lock on the entire file
space: if there is no lock.
</code></pre>

<p>It is not very likely that you will need the above but the explanation above must be sufficient.
* TYPE
In Unix-based systems everything is a file. Hard-drives, usb sticks, sockets or processing text, everything is backed by a file in our “favourite” Operating System. <code>TYPE</code> aims to explain what a listed <code>FD</code> is about.  The list here is endless. Use the following hacky command to get to the section of the <code>lsof</code> documentation listing all the different types:
<code>man lsof | grep -A 200 &quot;       TYPE&quot; | less</code>
* DEVICE
This column represents the device on which the file is attached or a hex address. If <code>DEVICE</code> value is a device then you can run <code>diskutil list</code>  on a osX machine to get a mapping between the integer you see under this column and the device that it represents.
* SIZE/OFF
This is the size of the file or file offset in bytes. This is an optional value.
* NODE
Unix-based filesystems use a data structure to store filesystem objects. For typical filesystem files, the <code>NODE</code> represents the number of the said object. It can also be the Internet protocol type e.g <code>TCP</code> or <code>UDP</code> as well <code>STR</code> if the open file represents a stream. There are a couple of other available types that you will probably never need.
* NAME
This is one of the most useful columns for most of the uses cases. It is actually the name/path of the open file.</p>

<h2 id="finding-internet-related-files-using-specific-ports">Finding Internet related Files using specific ports</h2>

<p>So far, we have learnt that everything in UNIX-based systems are getting represented by files. An Internet connection wouldn’t differ.
In order to find what process has allocated a specific port we can run the following command</p>

<pre><code>$ lsof -i :8080
COMMAND   PID USER       FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
java    39734 georgios  171u  IPv6 0x20964e8e5af3b6db      0t0  TCP *:http-alt (LISTEN)

</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>-i</code> is being used to only consider internet related files.</p>

<h2 id="finding-open-files-managed-by-a-specific-executable">Finding Open Files Managed by a Specific Executable</h2>

<pre><code>$ lsof -c java | less
COMMAND   PID USER       FD     TYPE             DEVICE  SIZE/OFF                NODE NAME
java    38866 georgios  cwd      DIR                1,5       672          8617079685 /Users/georgios/projects/...

</code></pre>

<p>This command aims to capture all the different open files that have been opened by a specific executable, in this particular example, the executable is <code>java</code>.
Have in mind that the command above might list open files managed by different processes that have all been started using the <code>java</code> executable.</p>

<h2 id="finding-which-process-manages-an-open-file">Finding which process manages an open file</h2>

<p>This uses case is the reverse of the one above.  We do list all processes having open files within a certain directory (<code>+D</code>)</p>

<pre><code>$ lsof +D &quot;/tmp&quot;
COMMAND    PID USER        FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF       NODE NAME
ssh-agent 2720 georgios    3u  unix 0x20964e8e45f0f84b      0t0            /private/tmp/...
</code></pre>

<p>These are some of the typical uses cases that I am using <code>lsof</code> for. I might come back with more of those but until then I am hoping that the above explanation is useful enough.</p>
